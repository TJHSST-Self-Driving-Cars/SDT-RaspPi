Hello there!

Make sure to include this import statement at the top of your code:
    from LidarController import LidarController

Create a new LidarController with:
    lidar = LidarController()



lidar.data:
    returns the raw data of angles and distances that the lidar takes in

lidar.relativePositions
    returns a list of (x, y) points that the lidar hits
    Note: these points are relative to the lidar and do not represent points in a fixed position nor rotation

lidar.curAngle
    returns what direction the lidar is currently shooting its laser beam (0->360)
    Note: this is nice for error correction because points that have not been checked by the lidar recently might be a little unreliable

start(): 
    starts the lidar 

stop():
    stops the lidar



Its that simple. Now you too can be a professional coder
